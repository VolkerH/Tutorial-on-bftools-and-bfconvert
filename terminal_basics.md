# Basic commandline concepts

WORK IN PROGRESS

### Starting a command line interpreter (or terminal)

On Windows the standard commandline interpreter is `cmd.exe` (there is also Windows Powershell and more recently a Terminal application). The instructions here are for `cmd.exe`. Click on the Search icon next to the Windows start menu and type `cmd.exe`. The command prompt app should be the main search result, click on it (or press enter to start it).

On the Mac, [`Terminal.app`](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) is the standard commandline executor. You can find it in `/Applications/Utilities/` or use the search function and start typing `Terminal`.

If you use Linux, we assume you are already familiar with command line usage. Otherwise, you can pretty much follow the instructions. 


### The command prompt and typing a command 

Both on Mac/Linux and ond Windows the terminal will greet you with a command prompt, typically showing you the _current working directory_ as the command prompt. After opening the terminal your working directory is typically your home directory.
